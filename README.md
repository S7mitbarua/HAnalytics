# Healthcare Analytics Project
## Overview
Welcome to the Healthcare Analytics Project! This project showcases the implementation of a healthcare analytics system using Google Colab. The primary goals include generating synthetic patient data, exploring basic statistics, visualizing data distributions, and training machine learning models for disease prediction based on age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

  ## Setup
  ### Clone the Repository
- Clone this repository to your local machine using the provided Git command.

  ### Install Dependencies
- Ensure you have the required libraries installed by following the instructions in the requirements file.

  ### Open the Notebook
- Open the Healthcare_Analytics_Project.ipynb notebook in Google Colab by following the provided link.

  ### Generated Data
  The project generates synthetic patient data, including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and a binary indicator of disease presence.

  ### Data Exploration
  Explore basic statistics, histograms depicting age distribution, and visualizations of correlation matrices within the notebook.

  ### Machine Learning Models
  The project employs two distinct machine learning models. Firstly, the Logistic Regression model is trained on standardized features such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol. The evaluation process for    this model includes assessing accuracy metrics and generating a confusion matrix. Secondly, the Random Forest Classifier is trained on raw features, and its evaluation involves the presentation of accuracy    metrics along with a detailed classification report. These models collectively contribute to the healthcare analytics system, providing insights into disease prediction based on diverse patient    characteristics.
